Explanation:
In this demo, we have created a simple HTML page with a header, main content section, and a footer. We'll use CSS and media queries to demonstrate the concepts of Responsive Web Design.

Setting Up: In the <head> section of the HTML file, we link the external CSS file styles.css and set some basic styles for the body to remove default margins and padding and apply a background color.

Styling the Header: We style the header with a dark background color (#333), white text color (#fff), centered alignment, and some padding to create a navigation bar-like appearance.

Styling the Navigation Menu: We style the navigation menu with a top margin to create space between the header and the menu items. The menu items are displayed horizontally using display: inline-block;, and each item has a right margin to separate them.

Styling the Main Content: We style the main content section with padding and a white background color.

Styling the Section: The content inside the <section> is given a max-width of 800px and is horizontally centered with margin: 0 auto;.

Styling the Footer: We style the footer with a dark background color (#333), white text color (#fff), centered alignment, and some padding.

Media Query for Responsive Design: We use a media query to adjust the styles when the screen width is less than or equal to 768px. The media query modifies the body and header padding, and reduces the margin between the navigation menu items to create a more mobile-friendly layout.

Step 3: Result
When you open the index.html file in your browser, you should see a responsive web page with a navigation bar, main content, and a footer. If you resize the browser window, the layout will adjust to be more mobile-friendly when the screen width is less than or equal to 768px.

This demo visually demonstrates the basics of Responsive Web Design, covering the concepts of Media Queries and Creating a Mobile-Friendly Layout. You can experiment with different media query breakpoints and styles to create more complex responsive layouts for your web pages.
